# Vic-A-Sketch
A basic pixel art program for Commodore VIC-20 with Super Expander.

<br/>

### Requires:
- VIC-20 with joystick
- Super Expander with 3k RAM

### Controls:
- Joystick to move cursor
- Fire button to draw or delete pixels
- F1 to turn on DELETE mode, F3 to turn off
- F5 to turn on FASTMOV mode, F7 to turn off
- ‚Üê to exit (prompts you to type Y/N to confirm)

### Current bugs:
- Changing to FASTMOV mode, while DELETE mode was on, then changing back to normal movement, will make it appear as if you are in DRAW mode. However, the program is still in DELETE mode. Press F3 to make sure you are in DRAW mode.

No PRG files we type-in like it's 1981
